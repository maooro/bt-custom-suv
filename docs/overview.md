# Project Overview

## Project Description
This project consists of a fully custom-designed Bluetooth machine along with its dedicated controller.  
Both the machine and the controller were designed and developed entirely from scratch, including hardware schematics, PCB layouts, and firmware.

The goal of this project was to create a reliable and modular system with efficient communication between the machine and the controller, optimized for low power consumption and maintainability.

## System Architecture
The system is divided into two main components:

1. **Machine**
   - Hardware: custom PCB, sensors, actuators
   - Firmware: real-time control, Bluetooth communication, input processing

2. **Controller**
   - Hardware: custom PCB
   - Firmware: communication with the machine

## Key Highlights
- Full custom design of both machine and controller
- Modular and maintainable architecture
- Low power and efficient Bluetooth communication
- Ready for firmware updates and future improvements
